## Who's vibing?

Who's vibing is a little 2 players game made for the valentine's day.
You should try to hide as if you were a bot, while searching for the other one.
The closer you are from your partner, the faster the vibes will be.

When you know who your partner is, you can kill them to win the round.
The loser will have a permanent increase in their vibes~ Good luck~
